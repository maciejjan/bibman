TODO

- bug: the column widths in the list do not adapt to added/edited entries
- key as a normal field? (since not used for indexing)
- sorting entries (by one of the columns)
- "search" functionality: outside the menu class!
  - search and limit on specific fields
    e.g. :search author Janicki
- "limit" functionality
  - ListItem objects with "visible" flag
  - also possible: "selected" flag
- undo option
  - a queue of operations: "add", "edit", "delete" with previous states of the entries
    ("add": undef, "edit"/"delete": previous properties)
- proper scrolling (vertical and horizontal) on the edit screen
- more status messages (e.g. errors)
- keybinding tree
  - binding: key -> command -> function
  - but first: only binding of single keys without rebinding
