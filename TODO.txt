TODO

v. 0.3 alpha:
- support other document file extensions (e.g. .ps, .djvu)
  - iterate over an array of extensions and stop on the first one that is a
    valid file

further features:
- bug: <Backspace> sends <Del> on st?
- a command for taking notes -- spawn $EDITOR with file KEY.txt
  + the ability to search/filter based on those notes in bibman
- a command history
- configuration files
- optional and required fields
- do not allow duplicate keys?
- selecting multiple entries
- group operations, e.g. editing only common fields
- automatic key generation
- keybinding tree
  - binding: key -> command -> function
  - but first: only binding of single keys without rebinding
- user-defined keybindings and configuration
- localization
- sorting entries (by one of the columns)
- help screen, keybinding cheat-sheets
- allow to specify the relative paths of directories in which the documents and
  notes are held (e.g. "docs/", "notes/") - either globally or in a local
  "bibman.conf" in the same directory as the bibliography file
