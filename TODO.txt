TODO

further features:
- moving left/right (by one column) in the list view
- bug: <Backspace> sends <Del> on st?
- a command for taking notes -- spawn $EDITOR with file KEY.txt
  + the ability to search/filter based on those notes in bibman
- a command history
- configuration files
- optional and required fields
- do not allow duplicate keys?
- selecting multiple entries
- group operations, e.g. editing only common fields
- automatic key generation
- localization
- sorting entries (by one of the columns)
- help screen, keybinding cheat-sheets
- allow to specify the relative paths of directories in which the documents and
  notes are held (e.g. "docs/", "notes/") - either globally or in a local
  "bibman.conf" in the same directory as the bibliography file
