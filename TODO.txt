v. 0.2 alpha:
- sorting entries (by one of the columns)
- undo option
  - a queue of operations: "add", "edit", "delete" with previous states of the entries
    ("add": undef, "edit"/"delete": previous properties)
- autocompletion of commands and file names
  - (in TextInput)
  - also values (words in titles, author names etc.)

further features:
- optional and required fields
- do not allow duplicate keys?
- selecting entries
- group operations, e.g. editing only common fields
- keybinding tree
  - binding: key -> command -> function
  - but first: only binding of single keys without rebinding
